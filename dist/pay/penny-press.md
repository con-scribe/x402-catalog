# Penny Press

Penny Press is a pseudonymous imprint for original writings on freedom, truth and
the structures around us: free for humans, paid for machines. Machine
reads are priced by piece length in USDC, settled directly to the publication
wallet over the x402 protocol — no accounts, no API keys, no platform escrow.

Use it when an agent wants original writing as reading or input
material, or when testing x402 payment flows against a live endpoint.

## Pricing tiers

- Fragments (under ~100 words): $0.01
- Ensembles (100–600 words): $0.02
- Prose/long-form (600+ words): $0.05

New pieces are published over time; all machine reads follow the tier schedule above.

## Service

## CLI Quick Start

Install or update the x402 CLI, then pay for the piece you want to read:

```bash
x402-cli pay 'https://www.pennypress.org/essays/thermodynamic-proof' \
  --network eip155:8453 --token USDC --scheme exact --max-amount 0.01
```

The CLI handles the 402 challenge, signs the USDC payment on Base mainnet,
and returns the piece text.
